## Code Importing

Open the destination folder in the terminal and just type `git clone https://github.com/SGSITS-Exam-Module-2/Exam-Module-2.git` command.

## Running the Server

Navigate to the server root directory and install all dependencies for server side code using command : `npm install` and then run `npm start` to run the server on [PORT 5000](http://localhost:5000).

Our Server uses various environment variables which are stored in the `.env` file. <br>
Server uses cookies to handle authentication, which uses `JWT_SECRET` which is also defined in the `.env` file. <br>
Server uses nodemailer library to send email to examiners, which uses these env variables `MAIL_USER`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`. <br>

Note: Keep ***MySql*** installed beforehand because the project is database integrated and uses sql libraries.
<br>
For SQL set these env variables in the .env file: `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_DATABASE`

## Running the Client

Navigate to the client root directory and install all dependencies for client side code using command : `npm install` and then run `npm start` to run react on [PORT 3000](http://localhost:3000).
